## Overview

### Description

Forkly is an iOS application that leverages the Spoonacular API to enable users to search for recipes, view cooking instructions, and save favorite dishes locally. Built using Swift and SwiftUI, the app demonstrates integration with external APIs, data persistence, and clean UI practices.

Our team began development in a shared repo using milestone-based planning. Midway through, we encountered architectural challenges and UI limitations that constrained our ability to move forward efficiently. After evaluating our options, we made a strategic decision to rewrite the app in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase. This allowed us to improve the core features while continuing to follow our original roadmap, ultimately delivering a more stable and user-focused final product.

### üîÅ Project Evolution

This repository represents the evolved version of our original app [Original Repo](https://github.com/COP4655-Group3/RecipeApp). The original repo contains early milestone planning and initial development. After identifying scalability and UI flow limitations, we transitioned to this new repo to refine and expand the app. Milestones here reflect continuation and improvement of the original goals.

#### Milestone Continuity
